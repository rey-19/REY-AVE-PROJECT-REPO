# THIS IS A NOTE LIST AND FEATURE LIST FOR PROJECT NMSTD

## This will include many details and possible links and indexes towards other files with their respective discriptions

*A basic plan through which could change based on the future planning of the project*


1. A entry is passed into NB under a specific database 
2. Said entry is passed via a python file using the api, to a script which stores necessary variables
3. The script (running in the background) will send a request to the to-do api, which changes or adds said entry into the respective page


To note:


+ The above plan given is one of the most stupidest simplifications been made, it's comparable to instructing a chemist to "heat stuff bro".
+ When an entry is passed, it should convert the necessary information into a variable or better yet, a dictionary
+ It should have a sync mechanism which allows the user to sync stuff (how we'll do that? idk)
+ If something bricks the whole setup, it needs a restart button
